# Direct debits

## Overview

To set up direct debits on Blink, you need to create a GoCardless account or connect your existing one. Having this enables you to set up and manage your direct debit payments alongside all your other payments within Blink.

Easily manage customer payments and subscriptions in one place. Test direct debit features without using real funds through integration with a GoCardless test account.

## How does it work?

### Creating/connecting your GoCardless account

1. Navigate to the direct debits area by selecting manage direct debits on the dashboard or using the left-hand navigation bar (customer centre > manage direct debits)
2. Choose a live or test account environment, log in to your existing GoCardless account or create a new one
3. Enter the relevant information on the GoCardless page to connect the account

import Highlight from '@site/src/components/General/Highlight';

<Highlight>
Once a GoCardless account is connected, two tabs will appear, customers and payments
</Highlight>
