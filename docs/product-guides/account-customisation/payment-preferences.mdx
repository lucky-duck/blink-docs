# Payment preferences

## Overview
The Payment Preferences page lets you designate the email for payment notifications and is under revision to permit you to adjust the compulsory fields on the "Take a Payment" page (Virtual Terminal).

## Navigation
Access the Payment Preferences by selecting it under "Payment Operations" on the left-hand navigation bar.

## How does it work?
- **Email Configuration:** On this page, you can designate an email for receiving Blink-generated merchant receipts. This setting supersedes the Blink contact email address configuration. Additionally, determine an email to field customer replies to Blink-generated emails (the default recipient is the account holder).
- **Email Routing:** Decide if you'd prefer the email notifications sent to the primary email, the user email, or both.

## Under revision
On the page's right side, there are toggles. These let you decide which fields are mandatory for customers to complete when they process a payment via the Virtual Terminal.

## Reminders
Establish reminders as a consistent rule across the entire merchant account.
