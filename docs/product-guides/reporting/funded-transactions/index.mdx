## Error codes to look out for

:::caution
<b>Pay link error - 'Please ensure you are human'</b>
<br />
This error code occurs when pay links are sent to primarily Chinese customers/customers making a payment from China. Google services are banned in China. Recaptcha, the verification software used for Blink transactions, is a google service and is therefore banned. The Captcha box will not even appear for Chinese customers, with the error code being the sole text displayed.
