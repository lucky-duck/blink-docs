# Blink pages
View your Blink pages, copy the links, and download the QR codes

## Overview

A Blink page is a fully customisable open web page that your customers can access anytime. The page can take payments via card, open banking or direct debit (depending on if this has been set up on your account). 

## Navigation

Select my [Blink pages](https://secure.blinkpayment.co.uk/admin/customer-centre/blink-pages) by navigating to the customer centre on the left-hand navigation bar or dashboard.

## How does it work?

Easily manage all of your active Blink pages with the ability to view and edit as needed. Any changes, such as uploading a logo or setting a custom background colour, will be reflected in the preview box to identify each Blink page quickly.

| Open in new tab        | This will open up the selected Blink page within a new tab in your browser.                                                                                                                                           |
| Edit page              | The edit page button allows you to edit the page's look, settings and fields as you wish.                                                                                                                             |
| Additional information | The information box displays the merchant name and MID assigned to that Blink page.                                                                                                                                   |
