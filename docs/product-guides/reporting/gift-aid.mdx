# Gift Aid transaction history

# Overview

In this guide, we delve into the functionalities of the **Gift Aid Transaction History** page and its general information.

**Gift Aid** enhances the value of donations to charities, allowing them to reclaim an additional 25% on every donation when the donor opts for Gift Aid. This effectively means an extra 25p for every £1 donated in a charitable transaction. For integration of Gift Aid with your Card and Open Banking donations:

1. Contact the Support Team for activation.
2. Note that an additional fee applies.
3. Specify if you'd like the feature added to Requested Payments (PayLinks) and/or your Blink Pages.

When donors choose Gift Aid, they must complete a declaration.

## Claiming Gift Aid

### Donor Specifications

- To view Gift Aid transactions:
  - Go to the `Reports` page.
  - Under the `Transactions` tab on the left-hand navigation bar, choose the `Gift Aid` tab.
  - This displays transactions where Gift Aid was selected.

- Filter the transaction by date if necessary.
- Download the transaction details by clicking on 'Export to CSV' at the table's base.
- The data should then be disclosed to HMRC to secure your Gift Aid claim.

For a successful Gift Aid claim:

- The donor should have paid an equal or higher amount in Income Tax or Capital Gains Tax within that fiscal year.
- Donors must submit a Gift Aid declaration allowing the claim.
- Only recognised charities or community amateur sports clubs (CASC) can make a claim.

### Example

Assuming the donor is a basic rate taxpayer:

- They pay 20% tax to HMRC over earnings of £125, which is £25.
- The donor retains £100, which they then donate.
- If they authorize a Gift Aid declaration, the charity can reclaim the £25 tax paid to HMRC.
- Thus, after claiming Gift Aid, the charity receives a total of £125.
