# Errors and HTTP responses

Blink Payment utilises standard HTTP response codes to signify the outcome of an API request. Here's a general overview:
- Codes in the 2xx range signify success.
- Codes in the 4xx range represent errors based on the information given, like missing a necessary parameter, request conflicts, or unauthorised access.
- Codes in the 5xx range point to issues with Blink Payment's servers. These instances are uncommon.

Certain 4xx errors, which can be programmatically addressed, come with an error code that briefly describes the reported error.

### HTTP response code meanings
