# Reporting summary page

## Overview

The summary page displays the total amount of your transactions and their revenue across all payment methods supported by Blink, as well as the most recent batches funded to you by your acquiring bank.

## Navigation

To access the summary page:
1. Select **Summary** on the dashboard.
2. Alternatively, navigate to **Summary** under **Reporting** on the left-hand navigation bar.

## Summary Tiles

The Summary page features tiles that represent data from various payment types:

- **Blink Card Payments**: Sum of all card transactions that customers made on Blink and payments from websites integrated with Blink.
- **Card Terminals**: All card-present transactions that customers paid from physical terminals. (Only available for merchants using AIB as their acquirer.)
- **Mobile App**: Total of all Card Payments taken using the Blink Mobile App linked with an external pin pad device.
- **All Card Transactions**: Sum of all card transactions, encompassing those from Blink, card terminals, and other payment gateways.
- **Open Banking**: All Open Banking payments that customers made either on a Blink page or through Requested Payments.
- **Direct Debit**: All direct debit payments processed either via Requested Payments, Blink Pages, or "Take a payment."

> Note: The "Card Terminals" and "All Card Transactions" are only updated when funded by the acquirer. It might take a few days for transactions to reflect. These sections don't include Amex card transactions.

### Most Recent Funded Batches 

This section displays the three latest batches funded by the acquirer. Each entry shows the funding date and the amount. Clicking a batch redirects you to the Bank Reconciliation page, offering a detailed breakdown of the payments constituting the batch.

## Further Actions

### Filter your transactions

- The default view shows totals for today's transactions* (see note below).
- You can modify the date filter to showcase your desired date range.

### Redirect

- Clicking a tile redirects you to its transaction history page, presenting a more detailed look at each transaction.

> Note: The “Card Terminals” and “All Card Transactions” sections display data from the previous day as it relies on Bank Reconciliation. Adjusting the date filter ensures all boxes represent the same period.
