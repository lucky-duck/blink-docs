# Delayed capture 

Overview
Our Delayed Capture function allows you to delay the capture for up to 30 days. Funds are being held until the planned date; you can, however, capture your Delayed Capture, early by navigating to the Online Card Transactions page under the Reporting section and locating the specific transaction. With an early capture, you have the flexibility to charge your customer with a partial amount. 

You can find the Delayed Capture option on the Take a Payment page. The Take a Payment section is a feature on our Blink platform which allows you to manually process transactions by filling in your customerâ€™s card details or charge customers via an existing Direct Debit mandate.

## How does it work?

First, navigate to the Take a Payment page. Select which MID you want to take the payment for and select Sale from the type of transactions available from the drop-down menu. Select the One Off payment type and the Card Payment method. 

Next, enter the customer's full name, email and a transaction reference, if applicable - which will be noted on the email receipt and transaction history. If you have multiple currencies enabled on your account, you can select the currency you wish to process the transaction using the drop-down list by clicking on the currency symbol.

When you set up a merchant account with us, you are asked which currencies to use to process transactions. You can request additional currencies to be added.

Choose with how many days you want to delay the automatic capture, with a maximum of 30 days.

Fill in the card and address details and click Charge. 

## Manual capture of payment 
The payment will be captured automatical. However, you can capture it manually and early, by navigating to the Online Card Transaction page under the Reporting section and locating the specific transaction and clicking on Capture. 

## Partial amount
With an early capture, you have the flexibility to charge your customer with a partial amount. 

## Reporting 
Once captured, you can find the details of your Delayed Capture transactions on the Online Card Transaction, All Card Transactions and Bank Reconciliation pages.
