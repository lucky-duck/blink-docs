You can view all your Blink card transactions by selecting **Blink Card Transactions** under the **Reporting Section** on the left-hand navigation bar.

This page displays all online transactions that have been processed. Each transaction will show the following:

* Date and Time

  * This contains both your custom reference and the transaction description. (Transactions without Blink in their description are integrated payments)
* Status
  * **Pending**
  * **Received** - The gateway has received the transaction and is awaiting a response to reach its final state.
  * **Deferred** - This transaction could not be settled due to a temporary problem but will be retried at the next available instance.
  * **Successful**
  * **Captured** - The transaction was successful. (This will update to Accepted, usually in the early hours of the following morning)
  * **Accepted** - This transaction has been accepted and settled as soon as possible.
  * **Pre-Auth** - This confirms that the card is authentic and that the amount is available in the cardholder’s account.
  * **Verified** - The authenticity of this card has been verified.

    * **Referred** - This transaction has been referred for manual approval by the Acquiring bank.
