import Accordion from "@site/src/components/General/Accordion";

<Accordion question="What are Direct Debits?">
A direct debit is an automated payment method authorising a business to collect funds directly from your bank account on an agreed date. The authorisation is given by you through a direct debit mandate agreement.

Your bank will release the funds on the permitted dates directly to the business, requiring no further action from you.

The amount can be variable depending on how much you owe the business. However, the company must inform you of the fee prior to you being charged.

Direct debits are convenient for subscriptions, regular bills, and recurring transactions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion question="Why pay through Direct Debits?">
There are many benefits to paying through direct debit. It is a safe and secure method of payment, and it is also convenient. 

Direct debit is the safest form of transacting as there is a legal agreement between you and the business

It provides your customer the option of spreading the cost rather than paying in one lump sum

<Accordion question="What is 3DS?">
3DS checks, also known as 3D Secure checks, are an additional layer of security for eCommerce payments. 3DS stands for "Three-Domain Secure" and is a protocol designed to authenticate the cardholder during online transactions.

The purpose of 3DS checks is to reduce the risk of fraudulent transactions and provide increased security for both merchants and cardholders. When a customer makes an online payment, the 3DS process verifies the transaction by authenticating the cardholder's identity using a combination of information and authentication methods.

Here's a brief overview of how 3DS checks work:

Initiation: When a customer proceeds to make a payment on an eCommerce website, the merchant's payment gateway initiates the 3DS process.

Redirection: The customer's payment is redirected to the card issuer's authentication page, which may involve a pop-up window or a redirect to a separate webpage.

Authentication: The cardholder is prompted to provide additional information for authentication. This can include a One-Time Password (OTP), a PIN, or biometric verification, depending on the card issuer's implementation.

Authorisation: The card issuer validates the authentication information provided by the cardholder and sends a response back to the merchant indicating whether the transaction is authorized or requires further action.

Completion: The merchant's payment gateway receives the authorisation response from the card issuer. Based on this response, the transaction is either completed, declined, or marked for additional review.

By implementing 3DS checks, merchants can mitigate the risk of fraudulent transactions and reduce their liability for chargebacks. It provides an added layer of protection by confirming the cardholder's identity, making it more difficult for unauthorised individuals to make fraudulent payments.

It's important to note that the specific implementation and requirements of 3DS checks may vary depending on the card issuer, payment gateway, and the version of 3DS being used (such as 3DS1 or 3DS2). Our gateway uses 3DS2.

<Accordion question="What is PSD2?">
Payment Services Directive 2, is the latest version of EEA (European Economic Area) regulations for the card payments industry. The directive increases the safety of cardholder data, especially for online transactions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion question="How do I apply for an additional Merchant ID for a new store or site?">
To apply for an additional Merchant ID for your new store or site, you need to determine the type of MID you need first. These types can be ECOM (for online payments), Card present (for in-person payments), or MOTO (for over-the-phone payments). If you need more than one type, please specify the anticipated split of the merchant ID. 

You will also need to provide proof of banking, both where funds will be withdrawn from and deposited into. This proof should be recent (dated within the last 3 months). 

Additionally, inform about the Average Transaction Value, the Anticipated Card Turnover, any Hardware or Software Requirements, Main Contact Details, Trading Address, and Proof, AML Documentation for Directors, and NDX/Lead Times.

<br /><br />
For AIB, you need to provide a proof of your new address, dated within the past 3 months. Send an email stating your change of address request, including your merchant ID and trading name. You can send your correspondence to AIB Investigations team at aibinvestigations@aibms.com and CC us at support@blinkpayment.co.uk.

<Accordion question="What should I do if I change my bank for charges, deposits or both?">
If you change your bank for charges, deposits or both, you need to notify both Blink and your acquiring bank. 
<br /><br />
For Blink, you need to inform our support team. Let them know if you wish to change where Blink charge you from, and if needed, they will send you a fresh Direct Debit form which will be amended by our accounts team upon completion. Also, specify whether your bank change is for charges, deposits or both, and if the new proof of bank doesn't match the name on the previous bank account, this will require a Change of Legal Entity process. 
<br /><br />
For acquiring banks, you'll need to send an email with necessary details, such as a recently dated bank statement for the account where the bank currently pays funds into, a recently dated bank statement or welcome letter for the new account, an uncertified ID etc. For AIB, this should be emailed to aibinvestigations@aibms.com and for Elavon, to support@blinkpayment.co.uk. Blink will log the change on our system and forward your request to Elavon.
<br /><br />
Be aware that the change with AIB takes 3-5 working days and with Elavon, approximately five working days.

<Accordion question="What is classified as a change of legal entity and how do I apply for it?">
A change of legal entity is when there is a modification to the entity that is financially and legally accountable for the activities performed under the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS). 

If you are changing your legal entity, we will need to submit a new application to the bank and get a new merchant ID. After it is active and all the aspects like assets and gateways are transferred, the old account can be closed to avoid further charges. 

Please note that there is a £250 Admin Fee for a Change of Legal Entity.

<Accordion question="What is a chargeback?">
A chargeback is a transaction that has been officially disputed by either the cardholder or the cardholder's issuing bank. It is crucial to minimise the risk of chargebacks during the sale process by adhering to the guidelines and requirements set out by card schemes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion question="Who deals with the chargeback?">
The chargeback is handled by the customer's issuing bank on behalf of the customer. Your acquiring bank, either AIB or Elavon, will dispute the chargeback on your behalf using any evidence or information you may have. The acquiring banks send a "re-presentment" to the issuing bank to support the validity of the disputed transaction. Please note that Blink cannot be involved at any stage of this dispute process.

<a href="https://www.elavon.co.uk/customer-centre/setting-up-your-account/chargebacks/chargeback-faqs.html">Evavon Chargeback FAQs</a>
</Accordion>

<Accordion question="What are common reasons for customers to raise a chargeback?">
Common reasons for customers to raise a chargeback include:

Fraud: This occurs when a customer claims they did not authorise the transaction or a fraudulent transaction was made using their credit card.

Non-Delivery: A chargeback may be raised if a customer claims that they did not receive the goods or services they paid for.

Quality/Not as Described: If a customer claims that the goods or services were not as described or were of poor quality, they may raise a chargeback.

Duplicate Processing: Chargebacks can be raised if a customer is charged multiple times for the same transaction.
</Accordion>

<Accordion question="Who notifies for chargebacks?">
For AIB merchants, notifications about chargebacks are sent by AIB through a letter to your registered address. AIB can also provide email notifications, and chargebacks can be viewed on AIB Insight.

For Elavon merchants, notifications regarding chargebacks are sent directly from Elavon, usually via email from disputes@elavon.com.
</Accordion>

<Accordion question="How can I contact AIB or Elavon Chargebacks Team?">
You can contact the AIB Chargebacks Team at 0126 829 8981. 

The Elavon Chargebacks Team can be reached at 0203 46 72 705.
</Accordion>

<Accordion question="What are the stages of a chargeback?">
The chargeback process consists of seven stages:

Stage 1: The customer contacts their card issuer to specify which transaction they want to reverse.

Stage 2: The card issuer investigates the customer's claim.

Stage 3: If the card issuer agrees with the customer's claim, they recover the money from the merchant’s account, provide a conditional refund to the cardholder, and advise the acquiring bank, who in turn advises the merchant.

Stage 4: The merchant can review the card issuer’s decision and choose to contest it by submitting their own evidence to support their case. This evidence is sent back to the acquiring bank, and then on to the card issuer.

Stage 5: The card issuer evaluates the cases presented by both sides. If the merchant’s case is considered more persuasive, they reverse the conditional refund, concluding the chargeback.

Stage 6: If the card issuer finds in favor of the cardholder, the merchant can request for the matter to be reconsidered and provide further evidence if available.

Stage 7: The final decision is made by the card scheme rather than the card issuer. This decision is binding and cannot be challenged further, other than through court proceedings.

<Accordion question="What is MOTO payment and how can I increase its security?">
MOTO or Card not present payments are one of the common ways fraudulent transactions occur. To increase the security of your MOTO payments, make sure you are set up for Address Verification Service (AVS) and Card Verification Value (CVV/2) checks. You might need to specify these as rules for your MOTO transactions on your virtual terminal or ask your terminal provider to adjust your physical terminal settings to include address and postcode check. It's essential to note that even with these measures, there is still not complete protection against chargebacks if the transaction is unrecognized by the real customer.
</Accordion>

<Accordion question="What precautions should be taken when accepting Over the Phone Payments?">
Considerations should be made when accepting Over the Phone Payments, especially from new customers. Even after confirming the postcode and address, businesses are not entirely shielded against a chargeback if the original customer doesn't recognize the transaction. Therefore, we highly discourage taking over the phone payments from new customers.
</Accordion>

<Accordion question="How can I protect my eCommerce site from fraudulent activities?">
Fraudsters often attack eCommerce sites by running stolen card details through a gateway using an automated program. You can prevent such attacks by enabling CAPTCHA checks on your site, which must be implemented by a web developer. Also, enabling 3DS checks on your online payment method will help prevent fraudulent transactions. It is a requirement for 100% of e-commerce transactions to have 3DS checks enabled by March 2022. All Blink users who use Blink Page or Pay Links have been automatically enrolled for these checks.
</Accordion>

<Accordion question="What should I be aware of when accepting card present transactions via a physical terminal?">
Be wary of customers who spend a long time entering their card details or appear to be entering long PIN numbers. Fraud can occur when a customer takes the machine, cancels the transaction and re-enters the details using a card not present (MOTO) method with stolen card details. The actual cardholder can then claim the transaction as fraudulent, resulting in a chargeback to the merchant and loss of funds to the real cardholder.
</Accordion>

<Accordion question="Where can I locate the invoices from Blink?">
All the invoices from Blink are made available on your Blink Portal. On the Blink 2.0 - Blink - The Everything Payments Platform, navigate to 'Payment Operations' followed by 'Plans & Invoices' to access your invoices.
</Accordion>

<Accordion question="What if I'm missing an invoice?">
If you're missing an invoice, immediately let the Support Team know. They will carry out an investigation and assist you with recovery.
</Accordion>

<Accordion question="What is PCI?">
PCI, or Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, is a requirement for all merchant banks to ensure a merchant is PCI Compliant.
</Accordion>

<Accordion question="Who needs to be PCI compliant?">
The PCI DSS is applicable to ANY organisation, regardless of its size or number of transactions, that accepts, transmits or stores any cardholder data.
</Accordion>

<Accordion question="How quickly do I need to become PCI compliant?">
For new or 'live' merchants, a 3-month grace period is provided to achieve compliance without any non-compliance fees. AIB and Elavon typically send the link to set up on their portals within the first month of going 'live'.
</Accordion>

<Accordion question="What is the validity period of the PCI compliance certificate?">
The PCI compliance certificate is valid for 12 months. It can be easily 'topped up' via the relevant PCI portal.
</Accordion>

<Accordion question="Can Blink assist with PCI compliance?">
Blink can help clarify Section 1, which is the business profile. The questions here are pretty straightforward and overview how you are processing payments and storing data. Unfortunately, Blink is unable to assist with Sections 2 & 3. Section 2 includes a scan that you must pass and Section 3 tends to be more technical and requires someone proficient in IT.
</Accordion>

<Accordion question="Can Elavon and AIB assist with PCI compliance?">
Yes, Elavon and AIB have dedicated PCI teams that can assist with any of the three sections. Contact the support to confirm which PCI package you have with Elavon. Reach Elavon PCI on 0330 808 3301 and AIB PCI on 0330 808 1652.
</Accordion>

<Accordion question="How can I access the PCI portal?">
For Elavon, access the Elavon Security Manager secured by Elavon Financial Services DAC. For AIB, visit the AIBMS Data Security AIBMS PCI DSS Program.
