# Payment links

Send payment links to your customers and track the status.

## Overview

Send payment links to your customers and track their status.

Payment links are unique one-use payment pages you can send to customers via SMS or email. Unlike the virtual terminal feature, customers can pay via card, open banking, or direct debit.

These payment links are tracked to see if and how your customer has interacted with the link.

## Navigation

Find payment links under the payments tab on the left-hand navigation bar (payments → request a payment).

## How does it work?

1. Select which MID you want to take the payment for 
2. Select the type of transaction from the drop-down menu listing: sale, pre-auth card, and verify.


import Highlight from "@site/src/components/General/Highlight";

<Highlight>
<b>Sale:</b> Immediate payment transaction
</Highlight>
<Highlight>
<b>Pre-auth:</b> This enables you to confirm that the customer has sufficient funds. It should be noted that no funds are taken or ring-fenced - you have 30 days to capture the amount
</Highlight>
<Highlight>
<b>Verify:</b> Verifies the authenticity of the card. This can be used as an anti-fraud check.
