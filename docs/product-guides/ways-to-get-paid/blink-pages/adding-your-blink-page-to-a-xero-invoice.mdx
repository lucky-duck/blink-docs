Once you have added Blink as your standard payment service, it will automatically apply to invoices using the template

1. Fill in your invoice as required, and send it off
2. After sending the invoice through Xero, a pay now button will be automatically included on the online invoice. The customer can use this button to make the payment without requiring a Xero login. In classic invoicing, the button can be added to an approved or repeat invoice template, while in new invoicing, it can be added to a draft or approved template
3. The pay now button on the invoice will take the customer to the relevant Blink page

### Reporting

### Xero

When a customer pays you online, Xero marks the invoice as paid (you don't receive an alert or notification). Xero displays the transaction reference ID from the payment gateway in the transaction's reference field.

### Blink

In Blink, you can check out the payments made through the appropriate payment methods in the reporting section.
