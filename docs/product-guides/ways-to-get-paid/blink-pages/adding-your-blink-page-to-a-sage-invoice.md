# Adding yout Blink page to a Sage invoice

Go through the steps of adding a Blink page to a Sage Invoice.

## How does it work?

1. Set up your invoice payments on your Sage pay account
2. On Sage, you can now include a "pay now" button on your invoices. To learn how to set this up, please refer to their [documentation](https://desktophelp.sage.co.uk/sage200/professional/content/general/InvoicePaymentsCustom.htm) for more details.
3. Once added, you need to match the fields on your Blink page to the ones on Sage to link the button
4. Navigate to the customiser within the customer centre on Blink, click modify fields, and ensure the URL descriptors on Blink match the ones on Sage exactly
5. Choose the fields you want to showcase on the Blink page and save changes
