## Navigation

- Acquirer funding
- Funding date
- Your Merchant ID (MID) with the acquirer (multiple MIDs might be present)

By clicking `View`, a right-sided table will pop up, showing the transactions comprising the chosen batch, including refunds. Information available includes Transaction Date, Card Brand, and Amount. Key details at the table's top include:
