# Personalising your Blink page

Choose which MID/page you want to update using the toggles above the Blink page section.

Here are the different sections on your Blink pages that you can customize to make them more personal.

| Functionality                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Adding a banner                | Clicking the add banner icon allows you to upload a banner image (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF) to the bottom of your Blink page. _(It can be any size, though we recommend keeping it to 610px x 140px. You can change or remove the banner at any time)._                                                |
| Adding opening hours           | Show customers when you are open and available. Click the icon, toggle on openings hours on the top right, and input the correct time or say you are closed all day. You can also add your contact details here, so customers know how to reach you.                                            |
| Modifying fields               | Customise the settings of each field on your Blink page. Make sure you click save changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Selecting visibility           | You can hide the reference or description fields if you don't need them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Selecting required fields      | Select which fields are mandatory for the customer to fill in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Marking read-only              | If you use URL descriptors, you can mark some fields as read-only (e.g. blink.co.uk/clothingstore?amount=10), so the customer can't change it.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Changing display name          | Change the name of fields to suit your reporting needs better, and choose the information you want from your customer (e.g. change reference to invoice reference, description to message or full name to company name).                                                                       |
| Using URL descriptors          | Enhanced URLs allow you to prepopulate specific fields on the Blink page using the custom URL descriptor.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Changing URL slug              | To edit the URL slug of the page, head to settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Merchant shop                  | Choose which MID/page you want to update using the toggles above the Blink page section.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Updating your logo             | Clicking the change logo icon lets you upload your logo image (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF) to the selected Blink page. _(It can be any size, though we recommend keeping it to 200px x 200px. You can change or remove the banner at any time)._ If you do not upload a logo, your portal logo will be used by default (see settings); this can cause pixelation issues if the portal logo is too small. |
| Changing background colour     | Change the background colour of your Blink page by clicking the icon and choosing a colour or entering the RGB values manually.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Settings                       | These are settings for your Blink page, payment links, and virtual terminal. Select between payment settings and receipt settings.                                                                                                                                                              |
