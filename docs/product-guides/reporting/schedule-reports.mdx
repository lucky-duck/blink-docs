# Schedule reports

Leverage saved searches to schedule daily, weekly, monthly, or custom reports directly to your inbox, enhancing your reporting efficiency. This feature serves as an overview of business performance or provides a detailed analysis of specific payment types daily.

## Navigation

- To set up a scheduled report:
  1. Navigate to the **Blink Card Transactions** tab located under the **Reporting** tab on the left-hand navigation bar.
  
**Note**: This feature is currently exclusive to Blink Card Transactions.

## Setting Up A Schedule

1. On the **Blink Card Transactions** page, apply any filters you desire.
2. Save these parameters as a "Saved search" for future reference.
3. Once the report is saved, the **Schedule Reports** option becomes available next to the **Export to CSV** button.
4. Click on **Schedule Reports**. A pop-up will appear prompting you to select a saved report.
5. After making a selection, set the desired frequency and input the email address where you'd like the report to be sent.
6. Click **Save Report** to activate the scheduling.

### Frequency

- **Daily**: Filters to transactions from the previous day.
